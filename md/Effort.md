# Effort

When you look at the setup for this project, you see seven code modules, lots
of comments, and you wonder:

> OMG! how HUGE is this project?

All those comments are there to help you write the code. At the time of this
writing:

    $ wc -l src/*.hs
    400 total

That's what's given to you. Let me run the command again for the complete
project.

    $ wc -l src/*.hs
    471 total

So that's 71 lines of code in my completed project. Your mileage may vary.

The project is not huge, and I think you will learn something from it!
