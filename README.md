# edu-wumpus

This project is an extended Haskell exercise to build a [Hunt the
Wumpus](https://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247) game.

It assumes a basic knowledge of Haskell. You should understand how to write
simple functions. You should be armed with a copy of the [Haskell
Book](http://haskellbook.com/).

Once you have a familiarity with datatypes, through Chapter 11 of the Haskell
Book, I think you will be able to start on this exercise. You will probably end
up going to the book, but that's a good thing, since you'll be driven by your
desire to Hunt the Wumpus!

* [Installing](INSTALL.md): (read this!)
* [Hunt the Wumpus](md/Wumpus.md): Guide to the exercise.
* [Functors, Applicatives, and Monads](md/Monad.md): A refresher if you are confused.
